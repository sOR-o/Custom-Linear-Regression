# Custom-Linear-Regression
This repository contains a custom implementation of linear regression, a fundamental machine learning algorithm. The implementation is built from scratch, allowing you to gain a deeper understanding of how linear regression works under the hood. A simple yet powerful machine learning algorithm used for predicting numerical values. This project provides a unique opportunity to explore the inner workings of linear regression, allowing you to understand how the algorithm performs linear modeling, gradient descent, and more. Additionally, it provide examples of how to use this custom linear regression implementation on real-world datasets, specifically the housing prices dataset and diabetes dataset.

## Features

- Custom implementation of simple linear regression.
- Usage examples with real-world datasets.
- Detailed Jupyter notebooks for hands-on experience.
- Simple and well-documented code.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository : `https://github.com/sOR-o/Custom-Linear-Regression.git`
2. Install Dependencies : `pip install -r req.txt`
3. Run the Jupyter notebook/lab or Python script to see LR in action.

You can use the provided code as a starting point for your own custom LR projects. Feel free to modify and expand upon this codebase to fit your specific needs. If you'd like to contribute to this project, please open an issue or submit a pull request.
